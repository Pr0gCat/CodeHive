## Success Metrics

1. **Development Velocity**
   - Complete Phase 2-3 in 4 weeks
   - Full MVP ready in 8 weeks
   - Production ready in 12 weeks

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - 80%+ test coverage
   - Zero critical bugs
   - <5s page load time
   - <30s agent task execution

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive project creation (<2 minutes)
   - Clear progress visualization
   - Reliable agent execution (>95% success rate)
   - Automatic recovery from failures

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Claude API limits â†’ Implement robust queue system
   - Agent coordination complexity â†’ Start with simple workflows
   - Performance issues â†’ Profile and optimize early

2. **Schedule Risks**
   - Scope creep â†’ Strict MVP feature set
   - Integration challenges â†’ Test early and often
   - Unknown technical hurdles â†’ Time buffer in estimates

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2 implementation
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Create development environment
4. Start weekly progress reviews
