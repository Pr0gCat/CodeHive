# AI-Native TDD System - Development Progress

## 🎯 Vision

Transform CodeHive into an **AI-driven Test-Driven Development platform** that minimizes human interruption while maintaining quality through systematic test-first cycles.

## ✅ Completed Foundation (Phase 1)

### Database Architecture
- **✅ Cycle Model**: Tracks TDD cycles with phases (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REVIEW)
- **✅ Test Model**: Stores generated tests with execution results and status
- **✅ Query Model**: Handles AI decision points (BLOCKING vs ADVISORY)
- **✅ Artifact Model**: Manages generated code, docs, and configurations
- **✅ Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript definitions and status constants

### Core Engine
- **✅ TDDCycleEngine**: Manages the complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR-REVIEW lifecycle
- **✅ Phase Execution**: Automated progression through TDD phases
- **✅ Test Generation**: Framework for creating tests from acceptance criteria
- **✅ Implementation Generation**: Minimal code generation to pass tests
- **✅ Refactoring Logic**: Code quality improvement while maintaining green tests

## 🔄 In Progress

### Decision Point System
- Query creation for architectural decisions
- Blocking vs advisory urgency levels
- User response handling and development resumption

## 📋 Upcoming Tasks

### High Priority
1. **AI Test Generation System** - Real AI-powered test creation from criteria
2. **API Routes** - REST endpoints for cycle management
3. **Development Dashboard** - Live UI showing cycle progress

### Medium Priority
4. **Decision Point System** - Complete query handling logic
5. **Feature Intake Interface** - User-friendly feature definition form

### Low Priority
6. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end workflow validation
7. **Performance Optimization** - Database queries and caching

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Key Design Decisions
- **Cycle-Based Development**: Each feature becomes a trackable TDD cycle
- **Phase-Driven Progress**: Clear RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REVIEW progression
- **Query-Driven Decisions**: AI only blocks for truly important choices
- **Artifact Tracking**: Complete history of generated code and tests
- **Minimal Ceremony**: Focus on development, not process overhead

### Database Schema
```typescript
Cycle (TDD lifecycle tracking)
├── Tests (generated from acceptance criteria)
├── Queries (AI decision points)
└── Artifacts (generated code/docs)
```

### TDD Engine Flow
```
Feature Request → Cycle Creation → RED Phase (tests) 
→ GREEN Phase (implementation) → REFACTOR Phase (quality) 
→ REVIEW Phase (validation) → Completion
```

## 🎨 Planned User Experience

### Simple Dashboard
- **Active Cycle**: Current feature being developed
- **TDD Status**: Visual progress through RED/GREEN/REFACTOR/REVIEW
- **Decision Inbox**: Only blocking queries that need attention
- **Live Code View**: Generated artifacts in real-time

### Minimal Interruption
- AI continues working unless truly blocked
- Clear decision points with context
- Quick resolution and automatic resumption
- Focus on results, not process

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Development Speed**: Time from feature request to completion
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage and passing rates
- **User Satisfaction**: Minimal interruptions, clear progress
- **AI Effectiveness**: Successful cycle completions without human intervention
